# Getting Started

You are about to embark in the reading of the documentation that contains instructions to run my undergraduate final project. 

The project's main goal was to develop a neurofeedback-assisted meditation software which will provide auditory cues if the subjectsâ€™ mind starts to wander. To alert the user, the application will slowly increase the volume of the meditating guide until the point when the participant returns to their centre of focus, ordinarily breath.

The project's engine is built with Vue.js using Cortex API - the core piece of technology at EMOTIV which brings the brain computer interface to consumer.

The Cortex API is built on JSON and WebSockets, making it easy to access from a variety of programming languages and platforms.

**Mind the fact, to initialise the project you will have to use one of the EMOTIV's neuro-headsets.**

## Supported Software & Hardware

The headset I worked with for this project, is called _Emotiv EPOC+_. The project has been successfully developed by using _MacOS Catalina_.   
Other platforms and hardware that could support this app are listed on the official [Cortex API documentation](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/), below 'Getting Started' article.
