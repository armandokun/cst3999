# Prerequisites

### Create an Emotiv ID

As with other EMOTIV services, you are required to have an Emotiv ID account. You can create an ID on [www.emotiv.com](https://www.emotiv.com/).

### Create a Cortex App

Create the **application ID** and generate the corresponding **client ID** and **client secret** for your application in order to grant access to Cortex API.

1. Login to www.emotiv.com.
2. Go to My Account Dashboard \([https://www.emotiv.com/my-account/](https://www.emotiv.com/my-account/)\).
3. Select **Cortex Apps**.
4. Read the **Developers EULA** carefully and click **Accept** only if you agree to all the terms and conditions. You cannot develop an application that works with Cortex if you do not agree to all of the terms.
5. Enter the name of your new application - an application ID will be generated automatically in the form of `com.{your-username}.{application-name}`. Note that the app ID string must contain only alphanumeric characters \(A-Z, a-z, 0-9\), hyphens \(-\), and periods \(.\).
6. Click **Register Application**. A client ID and a client secret will be presented to you. Copy them to somewhere safe immediately **as the client secret will ONLY BE SHOWN ONCE ON THIS SCREEN FOR SECURITY**. If you lost it, you will have to generate a new application ID later.
